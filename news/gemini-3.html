            <h1>Gemini 3.0 rolls out - Will it DOOM US?</h1>
            <p>Google just rolled out Gemini 3 - It appears to be the best AI model yet. But will that help or damage Workers?</p>
            <p>Thats a question we asked us today. Gemini 3 tops all other Models in the Benchmarks we looked at - here is one of them:</p>

            <p>This would be great news, because most of you probably now that all of googles Models are completely free at <a href="https://aistudio.google.com" target="_blank">https://aistudio.google.com</a>.</p>
            <p>But we want to show the biggest and a really important criticism against AI in general: it will take our jobs, and the only one they <b>really</b> benefit are the people who are already on the top.</p>
            <p>We tested two practical examples, to see how easily AI can take a Developers job. Because the question is not "Will it take our jobs?" - but "When and how will it take our jobs?"</p>

            <p>The game lets you decorate one of 3 trees. You have 5 deco objects to choose from, including a topper.</p>
            <p>After you press SPACE to finsish, it rates you with an algorythm on how good the Tree looks.</p>
            <p>I was surprised how exact gemini 3 did this. It gave me exactly what I asked for, while every other model always made something wrong - remember, we are always using the first output ever.</p>

            <p>The AI did a good job here. I let it do a Portfolio website for a fictional politician from England.</p>
            <p>It didnt do everything 100% correct: There are no pages for the About, Priorities, etc. sections, but it jumps to that point in the same page. We didn't specifiy that tho, so its alright.</p>
            <p>I am also not sure if its intended that the image is out of its frame, but I kind of like the look.</p>

            <p class="title">Conclusion:</p>
            <p>We are not "doomed" just because there is a new AI model. But it is definetly terrifying what's happening, and developers should be aware that they might need a second option.</p>
